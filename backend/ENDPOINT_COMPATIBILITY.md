## Summary
✅ **COMPATIBILITY STATUS: FULLY COMPATIBLE**

All frontend API endpoints have corresponding backend implementations. The backend is fully compatible with the frontend.

## Implementation Notes
1. Both frontend and backend use JWT-based authentication
2. All endpoints that require authentication are properly protected with the `protect` middleware
3. Error handling is implemented consistently across all backend endpoints
4. Data validation occurs at the model level with Mongoose schemas
5. Proper authorization checks are in place for role-based access control
