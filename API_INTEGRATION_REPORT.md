## Additional Integration Notes

### API Services Used:
- `authService` - Authentication and user profile
- `dashboardService` - Dashboard statistics
- `groupService` - Group management
- `eventService` - Events and posts
- `churchService` - Church-related data
- `donationService` - Donation statistics

### Context Integration:

## Remaining Tasks
Some complex pages with extensive mock data may still need full API integration, particularly those with:
- Real-time chat functionality
- Complex form submissions
- Advanced filtering and search

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify all API endpoints return expected data structures
2. Test error handling paths
3. Ensure loading states work properly
4. Verify user authentication flow
